# Byte Buggy  

## 🚀 Description  
**Byte Buggy** is an obstacle-avoiding robot powered by an **Arduino** and equipped with **ultrasonic sensors**. It intelligently detects and navigates around obstacles, making real-time decisions to avoid collisions. This project demonstrates the practical application of embedded systems and automation in robotics.  

### 🔥 Features  
- Obstacle detection using ultrasonic sensors  
- Real-time navigation and decision-making  
- Controlled by an Arduino microcontroller  
- Efficient motor control for smooth movement

## 📌 How It Works  
1. The ultrasonic sensors continuously measure the distance to nearby objects.  
2. The Arduino processes the sensor data and determines the best path.  
3. The motor driver adjusts the wheel movement to steer the robot away from obstacles.  
4. The robot adapts dynamically to new obstacles in real-time.
